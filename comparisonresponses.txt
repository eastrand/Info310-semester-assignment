ANSWER:

Based only on the retrieved documents, the following African peace agreements (since 2000) include explicit DDR (or DDRR) provisions:

- Sudan (nationwide ceasefire/security arrangements text; doc ag270)
  - Commits to “credible, transparent and effective DDR processes.”
  - Sets detailed DDR principles: national ownership and state-led DDR institutions; international partners in a supportive role; fairness/equity in eligibility; community-based, gender-sensitive reintegration; transparency and accountability; demobilization of all child soldiers within six months; identification and family tracing for separated children within six months; UNICEF/ICRC support; and sustained international financial/logistical support.

- Sudan (Darfur peace text referenced by UN A/65/914–S/2011/449; doc ag853)
  - Re-establishes the North-Sudan DDR Commission with representation from the Movements.
  - UNAMID to verify Movements’ forces; UN agencies to assist with DDR planning and sequencing.
  - GoS to provide financial/logistical support; specific resources for women’s reintegration needs.
  - Parties to assemble former combatants; set eligibility criteria; and ensure release process for all child combatants.

- Sudan (Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement – ESPA; doc ag373)
  - Defines “Assembly,” “Assembly Areas,” and “Demobilization” in the context of disarmament and reintegration, embedding DDR concepts in the security arrangements of the agreement.

- Burundi (Pretoria decisions regarding FNL; doc ag713)
  - Decisions taken to remove obstacles impeding the Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) process, tied to facilitating recognition of the FNL as a political party and maintaining equity consistent with the 2000 Arusha Agreements.

- Central African Republic (Agreement on the principles of DDRR; UN S/2015/344; 10 May 2015; doc ag2035)
  - Articles 2–4 lay out DDRR scope and eligibility: covers combatants of all signatory armed groups; requires surrender of all weapons/explosives; explicitly includes children associated with armed forces/groups whether or not armed; provides for assembly at agreed sites under Government responsibility with partner support.

- Central African Republic (Political Agreement provisions on DDRR; UN S/2019/145; 2019; doc ag2147)
  - Article 6 underscores the National DDRR Programme and calls for rigorous, transparent management, with armed groups involved in strategic/technical bodies and funding via partners and State budget.
  - Provides modalities for those wishing to join uniformed services and establishes national committees to steer and monitor DDRR implementation in line with the 2015 DDRR principles agreement.

- Central African Republic (DDR-related commitments; doc ag2258)
  - Calls for recognition of DDRR stages; acceleration of “Great DDRRR”; integration of politico-military elements into security services; security assurances for disarmed/demobilized/billeted ex-combatants; dissolution of militias; regulation of arms (including homemade weapons); issuance of civil status documents to ex-combatants as part of DDRR; health/food support for billeted ex-combatants; and related SSR measures.

- Chad (Doha Agreement; doc ag2449)
  - Adopts a DDR programme aligned with international norms.
  - Two-stage DDR process: (1) from signature, political-military movements submit combatant lists with biometric data to the implementation committee; (2) after the National Inclusive Dialogue of N’Djamena, movements present verified counts of combatants, weapons, and locations (coordinated with neighboring-country authorities).
  - Also mandates removal of weapons from civilians and combating illegal arms possession.

- Democratic Republic of the Congo (Agreement with FRPI; Gety, 28 Feb 2020; doc ag2401)
  - Establishes a DDRR process in Ituri under Government lead with MONUSCO support.
  - Details: disarmament/demobilization to improve security and restore State authority; recovery/destruction of FRPI arms; demobilization and return to civilian life; integration of eligible candidates into Defense and Security Forces; short-term reinsertion via community violence reduction projects; and longer-term reintegration.

- Democratic Republic of the Congo (South Kivu provincial accord on DDR focal points; doc ag2409)
  - A co-signed local accord adopting six focal points tied to a DDR process (Community Demobilisation, Disarmament, Reinsertion, Reintegration, and Reconciliation), including a ceasefire commitment and steps to rebuild trust and restore State authority.

- Libya (Declaration of the Paris International Conference for Libya, 12 Nov 2021; doc ag2433)
  - Welcomes Libyan-led DDR initiatives and calls for a comprehensive, inclusive, nationwide DDR plan as part of a political settlement, with urgent assistance to Libyan authorities and attention to gender-based violence. (Note: this is an international conference declaration rather than an intra-Libyan peace agreement, but it explicitly addresses DDR in the Libyan peace process.)

QUESTION: What are the common themes regarding demilitarization in agreements signed in Africa
====================================================

ANSWER:

This answer is based only on the retrieved documents and may be incomplete.

Common demilitarization themes in African agreements (as reflected in the documents):

- Immediate cessation of hostilities and prohibitions on actions that risk re-escalation:
  - Ceasefire orders across all terrain (ag671; ag672).
  - Bans on attacks, provocations, sabotage, occupation of new positions, movement of forces/equipment, and resupply of arms/ammunition (ag671; ag672).
  - Local commitments to stop attacking convoys/humanitarian vehicles and to dismantle barricades/checkpoints (ag2196).

- Disengagement, redeployment, and creation of demilitarized/buffer zones:
  - Disengagement of armed groups, establishment of buffer/demilitarized zones, and structured redeployment to transit/mixing/demobilization centers (ag671; ag672).
  - Border-area demilitarization and phased redeployment along contested frontiers, supervised by observers (ag471).

- Mapping, identification, and control of forces:
  - Detailed geographic location/mapping of armed groups and formal ceasefire orders down the chain of command (ag671; ag672).
  - Obligations to transmit agreement contents to rank-and-file and maintain command and control during implementation (ag336).

- Monitoring, verification, and third-party oversight:
  - Joint verification/monitoring mechanisms and liaison teams with neutral international presence (ag336).
  - Deployment of UN observers (e.g., MONUC) to monitor ceasefires and buffer zones (ag671; ag672).
  - Supervision by Military Observers for demilitarization processes (ag471).
  - Community-level Joint Monitoring Committees for local accords (ag2196).

- Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR/PNDDR/DDRR):
  - Formal DDR/PNDDR/DDRR frameworks, including “mixing”/integration of combatants into national forces as appropriate, and use of demobilization/training centers (ag671; ag672; ag1442).
  - Demobilization allowances and support for ex-combatants (ag306; ag2258).
  - Employment and reintegration measures, including high-intensity labor projects (THIMO) and community reintegration initiatives (ag1442; ag2196).

- Arms control and militia dissolution:
  - Dissolution of all militias (ag2258).
  - Fight against arms trafficking; prohibition of home manufacture and collection of homemade weapons; regulation of hunting weapons (ag2258).
  - Repatriation of foreign mercenaries/foreign armed elements (ag2258; ag671/ag672 via disarmament and repatriation plans).

- Security guarantees and protection:
  - Security assurances for disarmed, demobilized, and billeted ex-combatants (ag2258).
  - Protection of civilians, including securing minority communities and safe humanitarian access (ag2258; ag2196).

- Local/community peace infrastructure and social cohesion measures linked to demilitarization:
  - Community commitments to denounce spoilers and establish joint monitoring/awareness efforts (ag2196).
  - Calls to suppress divisive militia labels, end media manipulation, and promote a culture of peace to support demilitarization (ag2258).

- Institutional and regional/international frameworks:
  - Emphasis on the apolitical nature/neutrality of national defense and police forces (ag722; ag306).
  - Use of UN/AU/OAU mechanisms and reference to regional/international resolutions and facilitation (ag818; ag471; ag722; ag336).
  - Technical cartographic support for border delimitation/demarcation tied to demilitarization (ag471).
  - Establishment of observatories on arms trafficking and related threats in the region (ag306).

- Practical de-escalation steps:
  - Dismantling of roadblocks/barricades by both local actors and peace operations (MINUSCA) (ag2196).
  - Sequenced processes: ceasefire → disengagement/buffer zones → observer deployment → movement to cantonment/mixing/DDR centers → integration/reintegration (ag671; ag672; ag1442).

QUESTION: What clauses in the 2004 Darfur peace protocol regulated the use of drones for monitoring?
====================================================

ANSWER:

- Based on the retrieved documents, none of the 2004 Darfur agreements or protocols contain clauses regulating the use of drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) for monitoring.

- The 2004 instruments referenced in the context establish monitoring through human-led mechanisms—AMIS, the Ceasefire Commission (CFC), the Joint Commission, observers, and sector sub-commissions—without mentioning aerial surveillance or drones:
  - Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement (8 April 2004) and Protocol on Humanitarian Assistance (8 April 2004) [listed as Annexures in the DPA].
  - Agreement on the Modalities for the Establishment of the Ceasefire Commission and the Deployment of Observers (28 May 2004, Addis Ababa), which sets up the Joint Commission and CFC/observers (ag92_…; ag751_…).
  - Protocols of 9 November 2004 (Improvement of the Humanitarian Situation; Enhancement of the Security Situation), referenced but with no retrieved text on drones.

- Monitoring provisions cited include:
  - Establishment and roles of the Joint Commission and CFC/observers (ag92_…; ag751_…).
  - AMIS-led demilitarized zones and monitoring responsibilities (ag350_…).
  - General strengthening of monitoring/verification mechanisms (Article 25 in the DPA, referencing AMIS/CFC/JC/JHFMU) (ag350_…).
  None of these mention or regulate drones.
